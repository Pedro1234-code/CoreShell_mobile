CoreShell Mobile is a UWP app that aims to create a better experience for mobile users based on Windows 10X shell. The shell is designed to run under the Windows MobileOS project.

Changes:

- Implemented Task View button

- Replaced app Action Center with system one

- Fixed Search (opens system Search application)

- Removed incompatible notification code so it can run on full Windows.

- The default background is the system background image (place the image in C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows before setting)

## :package: Building
To build the shell, you're gonna need a few things.
1. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (any edition works)
2. Make sure you've installed the `.NET Desktop Development` workload, along with the `Universal Windows Platform` workload.
3. Open the 10x-shell project by clicking the `factoryos-10x-shell.sln` file in your file explorer.
4. At the top of Visual Studio, click the `Local Machine` button to compile and start the shell in Debug mode.

> [!NOTE]  
> Since 10X shell is under development, you may not see any releases. Once a build is stable, it will be released.
